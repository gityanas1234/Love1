In your eyes, I find my peace, my endless sky,
With every smile, you make my heart fly.
Your love is the melody that my soul sings,
With you, I’ve found all that life brings.
Your touch is like a whisper of the stars,
A love so deep, no distance can keep us far.
In your embrace, I find my home,
With you, I’m never alone.
"Tu meri har subah ka ujala hai, meri shaam ka noor,
Tere saath ho toh, dil ka har dard bhi ho jata hai door."
"Har pal mein tu saath ho, dil mein tu baas ho,
Meri duniya ka har rang, bas tujhse hi toh khaas ho."
